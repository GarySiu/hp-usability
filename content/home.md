## Broken
* `Google play` and `App Store` buttons don't work in Safari
* `Register` and `Go to Paypal` mouseover effects inconsistent/bugged
* Mouseover on social media buttons cause them to disappear from view. Also non-standard and give no context (follower count?)

## Usability
* Preloader. Why?
* Thumbnail and lightbox image size barely different: not worth the click.
* Most recent content (twitter feed) is at the bottom of a long page
* Q's attribution is the same style as his blockquote. Hard to read.
* `Register as a pilot` suggests you can register as something else but there's no indication of what that other class of user is or how to register as one.
* Unclear what the differences between premium and free memberships are. Is there a breakdown?
* What is PPR? Is this something that a site owner would know?
* Given HP premium requires a HP registered email, would it not make more sense to have the form after you've logged in?
* Also given the importance, why is the premium option down at the bottom?
* Support chat gives no indication on whether anyone is online or how long a response is expected to take

## Style
* Text justification is all over the place. Avoid longer passages of centered text and right justified text.
* Is it possible to move the disclaimer to somewhere less prominent? It's given equal or greater emphasis than `the only reliable source of landing sites for helicopter pilots`.
* All the images of the app are framed by an iPhone (apart from a Nexus hidden in the back). Might be clearer if you show some UI without one. Also consider alternating with an Android device?
