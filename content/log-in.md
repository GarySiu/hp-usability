### Broken
* Email input field for signing up a new account doesn't actually do anything
* Clicking on the brand logo doesn't do anything (only tested in Chrome). It appears to be attached to some JavaScript though.

### Usability
* Generally fine. It is slightly strange that the reset page has a cancel button but this is very minor.
 
### Style
* Styling is different from the rest of the site
