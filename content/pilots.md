The pilots link in the topnav takes you to the `Find a Site` page. This isn't consistent with other top level links.

## Find a Site
### Broken
* Missing Google+ link.
* Airfields link seems to link directly to an unstyled page of every airfield in helipaddy on the admin site. Is this intentional?
* Possible to scrape how many/what sites Helipaddy has.

### Usability
* Unclear why you need an email and who the email should refer to.

### Style
* Compared to the text on the [home](../home/) page, the text is tiny and borderline unreadable.
* The call to action does not stand out at all and it is buried at the bottom of the page.
